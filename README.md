# CodingEventsDemo

The purpose of the app is to help the user to create local events into category's and the ability to attach tags to the entries for an easier search.

The current status of the app is usable, but the tag option is in progress and close to done. 

The third and final section should describe the future improvements you want to make to the app including your notes about the Person class.
